<h2>Overview</h2>

<p> CSPLib is a library of test problems for constraint solvers. The library consists of: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Problems organised by <a href="{{prefix_path}}/Problems/categories.html">subject area</a> and <a href="{{prefix_path}}/Problems">problem number</a></li>
</ul>

<p> CSPLib also maintains a list of <a href="{{prefix_path}}/Languages/index.html">constraint languages</a> and the tools which can be used to solve problems in these languages.</p>


<p>
The main motivation for CSPLib is to focus research in constraints away from purely random problems and onto more structured problems.
</p>

<p>
We currently have {{ num_problems }} problems in {{ num_categories }} <a href="{{prefix_path}}/Problems/categories.html">categories</a> proposed by {{num_authors}} <a href="{{prefix_path}}/authors.html">authors</a>.
</p>
