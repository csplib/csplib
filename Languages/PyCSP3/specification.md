Title: PyCSP3
Extensions: py

PyCSP3 is a Python library for writting, in a declarative manner, models of constraint satisfaction and optimization problems. Models are compiled into the intermediate format XCSP3, and can be directly solved with two embedded solvers ([ACE](https://github.com/xcsp3team/ace) and [Choco](https://github.com/chocoteam/choco-solver)).

On a dedicated [website](https://pycsp.org/), find more than 60 Jupyter notebooks for gently learning CP (Constraint Programming):

- understanding 25 popular constraints 
- understanding, step by step, 34 models of classical problems
