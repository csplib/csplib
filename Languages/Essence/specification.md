ESSENCE is a high-level constraint specification language; it allows a combinatorial (optimisation) problem to be specified at a level of abstraction above that at which modelling decisions are made.

The most notable feature of Essence is the support for high-level nested types, for example a 'set (size 3) of partition of int(1..20)'.

There has been one publicly available implementation of Essence:

* [Conjure](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure) is a complete implementation of the Essence language, which maps Essence to Essence Prime. Conjure is described in cite{AkgunThesis} and in cite{akgun2022conjure}.
