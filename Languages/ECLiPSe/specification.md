ECLiPSe is an open-source software system for the development and
deployment of constraint programming applications.  It is also used
for teaching most aspects of combinatorial problem solving, e.g.
problem modelling, constraint programming, mathematical programming,
and search techniques.  It uses an extended Prolog as its high-level
modelling and control language, complemented by several constraint
solver libraries, interfaces to third- party solvers (COIN-OR, Cplex,
Xpress, Gurobi, Gecode), a development environment and interfaces for
embedding into host environments.

ECLiPSe's offical web site is
[eclipseclp.org](http://www.eclipseclp.org), where source and binary
distributions can be downloaded.  There are also three ECLiPSe based
text books (see references), and an [online E-learning
course](http://www.eclipseclp.org/ELearning/).
