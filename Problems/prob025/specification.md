Consider a 111 by 111 binary matrix. The goal is to put 11 zeros in
each row in such a way that each column has 11 zeros, and each pair of
rows must have exactly one zero in the same column.

This problem is equivalent to finding a projective plane of order
10. It is also equivalent to the <111,111,11,11,1> BIBD problem [prob028].
