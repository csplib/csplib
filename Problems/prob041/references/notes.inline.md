Probably the first appearance of the 3-fractions puzzle in the
constraints literature is cite{schulte2004finite}.

The following paper shows how a basic model of the 3-fractions puzzle can be
improved automatically cite{frisch2001extensions}.

Using hand-reformulation, the following paper discusses how different
using symmetry-breaking schemes on the 3-fractions puzzle, followed by
the derivation of implied constraints, can lead to models of varying
quality cite{frisch2004symmetry}.

The following paper investigates the numerical issues arising when the number of fractions grows and two new CP models that exploit the integer factorization of the fractionsâ€™ denominators cite{malapert2017puzzle}.

The note cite{codish2018sat} describes a SAT encoding for the n-fractions puzzle for which a SAT solver found new solutions for some of the remaining open instances of this problem. 

Only the 44-fractions remains open when combining the most recent results of cite{malapert2017puzzle} and cite{codish2018sat}. 
Other n-fractions have been found or proven infeasible.
