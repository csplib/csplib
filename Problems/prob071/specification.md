### Overview
Given an undirected graph with a set of nodes and a set of links, the Diameter and Degree Bounded  Network Design Problem (DDBNDP)  is to  select a subset of links such that  there exists a path  between each pair  of nodes whose length is bounded by a given constant,
and the degree of each node must be greater than a given constant. The  objective is to minimise the  sum of the selected links.
