<h1>$n$-Queens Completion Problem</h1>
<p>The <span> <a href="/Problems/prob054">N-Queens</a></span> Problem, <span> <a href="/Problems/prob054">[prob054]</a></span>, suffers from the problem that its complexity is trivial as a decision problem.<br />
The n-Queens Completion and Blocked n-Queens problems are variants of <span> <a href="/Problems/prob054">N-Queens</a></span> which have been proven to
be NP-Complete as decision problems and #P-Complete as counting problems.</p>

<p>For the $n$-Queens Completion Problem, as well as board size $n$, one is given some number of queens placed 
on the board already. The problem is to provide a solution to the $n$-Queens problem containing all those queens. I.e. a superset of the preplaced queens of size $n$ and with no two queens on the same row, column, or diagonal.  (If any two of the preplaced queens attack each other it is considered to be trivially unsolvable).</p>
<p>The image shows an example problem, originating in 1850<span> <a class="bibref" data-bibfragment="Nauck1850a" href="/Problems/prob079/references/#Nauck1850a">[Nauck1850a]</a></span>.  Can you place the other 6 queens to give a solution to the 8-Queens problem?  And in how many ways is this possible?  The answers are shown below.</p>
<h1>Excluded Diagonals $n$-Queens Problem</h1>
<p>The Excluded Diagonals Problem is a closely related problem where, given an $n \times n$ board, only certain rows and columns are allowed and certain diagonals are excluded. 
For rows and columns, a subset of rows and columns are specified which are allowed. The subsets must be the same size.
A sum diagonal is the set of squares where the sum of the row and column indexes of the squares is constant.  A difference diagonal is the set of squares where the difference between the row and column indexes is constant.<br />
For the Excluded Diagonals Problem, we are given $n$ and a set of diagonals, each of which is either a sum diagonal or a difference diagonal. A solution is a set of queens with exactly one queen in each of the allowed rows and columns, and where where no queen is placed on one of the<br />
excluded diagonals.</p>
<h1>Relation between the two problems</h1>
<p>The two problems here are so similar it is best to think of them as the same problem, as processing to flip between them is very simple. </p>
<p>To go from $n$-Queens Completion to Excluded Diagonals is very easy: simply allow only rows and columns with no queens preplaced, and exclude any diagonals (both sum and diagonal) on which there are preplaced queens.  </p>
<p>The other direction is more complex but still fast, following a construction in<span> <a class="bibref" data-bibfragment="nqueenscompletion" href="/Problems/prob079/references/#nqueenscompletion">[nqueenscompletion]</a></span>. It is implemented in the python files 
<a href="models/diagtoqueens.py.html"><a href="http://diagtoqueens.py">diagtoqueens.py</a></a> and 
<a href="models/queens-diag-transform.py.html"><a href="http://queens-diag-transform.py">queens-diag-transform.py</a></a>.</p>
<p>The two problems are closely related to <span> <a href="/Problems/prob080">Blocked n-Queens Problem</a></span>, <span> <a href="/Problems/prob080">[prob080]</a></span>.</p>
<h1>Random Instance Generators</h1>
<p>Python generators are available to implement the models from the paper<span> <a class="bibref" data-bibfragment="nqueenscompletion" href="/Problems/prob079/references/#nqueenscompletion">[nqueenscompletion]</a></span>. 
The generator for random placement of queens for of n-Queens Completion is not recommended as it does not seem to produce hard instances. 
<a href="data/queens-diag-gen.py.html">The generator for random Excluded Diagonals n-Queens instances</a>
does appear to generate hard instances.  </p>
<p>Note that the generator for Excluded Diagonals always allows all rows and columns, so those are not outputted. It also offsets the difference diagonals by n-1 so that all numbers are non-negative. Also it generates a maximal set of diagonals which retain the property that there are at least k squares left in each row and column (e.g. k=4). The generator is designed so that, if you want fewer diagonals than that maximal
number, e.g. $d$, you can simply take the first $d$ diagonals and get a probabilistically valid sample.</p>
