Title: Discussion

To find just the best thrower, a ladder tournament is optimal. However, as Lewis Carrol pointed out, a ladder may not find the second best thrower (since they may be beaten by the best thrower in an early match). I solicit solutions to the problem of identifying the k best throwers where k > 1 (and especially for k=4 as this was the original question to comp.theory).
