	abstract = {The Dial a Ride family of Problems (DARP) consists in routing a fleet of vehicles to satisfy transportation requests with time-windows. This problem is at the frontier between routing and scheduling. The most successful approaches in dealing with DARP are often tailored to specific variants. A generic state-of-the-art constraint programming model consists in using a sequence variable to represent the ordering of visits in a route. We introduce a possible representation for the domain called Insertion Sequence Variable that naturally extends the standard subset bound for set variables with an additional insertion operator after any element already sequenced. We describe the important constraints on the sequence variable and their filtering algorithms required to model the classical DARP and one of its variants called the Patient Transportation Problem (PTP). Our experimental results on a large variety of instances show that the proposed approach is competitive with existing sequence based approaches.},

	abstract = {The Patient Transportation Problem (PTP) aims to bring patients to health centers and to take them back home once the care has been delivered. All the requests are known beforehand and a schedule is built the day before its use. It is a variant of the well-known Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) but it has nevertheless some characteristics that complicate the decision process. Three levels of decisions are considered: selecting which requests to service, assigning vehicles to requests and routing properly the vehicles. In this paper, we propose a Constraint Programming approach to solve the Patient Transportation Problem. The model is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate new constraints and objective functions. Furthermore, we introduce a generic search strategy to maximize efficiently the number of selected requests. Our results show that the model can solve real life instances and outperforms greedy strategies typically performed by human schedulers.},
