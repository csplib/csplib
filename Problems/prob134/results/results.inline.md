## Example Solutions of Toy MASP Instances

Here we sketch solutions for four different toy instances of the **Medical Appointment Scheduling Problem (MASP)**.

> **Note:** Resource calendars span **9 scheduling days**, each comprising **24 time slots**.

The MASP problem is scalable along several dimensions:
- **Number of scheduling days**
- **Number of slots per day**
- **Number of resources**
- **Types of resources**

To better understand how **slot identifiers** are used in our model, we recommend referring to our research paper available at:
