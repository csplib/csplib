---


This is a generalisation of the {prob030} proposed by [Marco Chiarandini](https://imada.sdu.dk/~marco/), [Luca Di Gaspero](http://www.diegm.uniud.it/digaspero/), [Stefano Gualandi](http://matematica.unipv.it/gualandi/), and [Andrea Schaerf](http://www.dpia.uniud.it/schaerf/index.php) at University of Udine .

With respect to the BACP, the GBACP adds:

* several curricula that can share courses
* soft constraints, in particular for teacher preferences for not teaching during some terms.
