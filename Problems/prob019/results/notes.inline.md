The smallest magic square is, of course, 1 by 1. There is no 2 by 2 magic square. There are, however, 3 by 3 magic squares. According to the Guiness Book of Records, the [largest known magic square](http://www.recordholders.org/en/records/magic.html) is 3001 by 3001 and was computed by Louis Caya (Sainte-Foy, Canada) in 1994.

Many examples of magic squares can be found [online](https://web.archive.org/web/20001202190000/http://www.pse.che.tohoku.ac.jp/~msuzuki/MagicSquare.html).

The smallest anti-magic square is 3 by 3. [Constructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20010214083954/http://www.uwinnipeg.ca/~jcormie/construct.html) exist for building anti-magic squares of larger sizes, but these do not give all possible squares.

Eliminating symmetry would appear to be very important in these problems, especially when counting solutions or proving none exits.
