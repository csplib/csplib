Suzanne Alejandre's [site](https://web.archive.org/web/20150917095142/http://mathforum.org/alejandre/magic.square.html) gives a good introduction to magic squares.

Mutsumi Suzuki also provides a comprehensive [set of links](https://web.archive.org/web/20001202190000/http://www.pse.che.tohoku.ac.jp/~msuzuki/MagicSquare.html) about magic squares.

See the related [magic hexagon](/Problems/prob023/) problem entry.

Numerous other links exist on the web.

Various code is available online for finding magic squares and other related problems:

-   some [Eclipse code](http://eclipseclp.org/examples/magicsquare.ecl.txt) for magic squares
-   some [Oz code](https://web.archive.org/web/19990218164231/http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~loeckelt/puzzles/square/) for magic squares and sequences
-   a [Java applet](https://web.archive.org/web/20061206055547/http://ff.iij4u.or.jp/~kanada/ccm/magic-square/index.html) for finding magic squares using a local search method
