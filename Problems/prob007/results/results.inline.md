The musical all-interval series have a certain prominence in serial composition; they can be traced back to Alban Berg and have been extensively studied and used by Ernst Krenek, for example, in his orchestral piece op.170, ``Quaestio temporis'' (A Question of Time).

Hoos describes the generalization of the problem and its formulation as a CSP and SAT problem in his PhD thesis:
[Stochastic Local Search - Methods, Models, Applications (PhD thesis, TU Darmstadt, 1998)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/ps/phd-thesis.pdf)

Simonis and Beldiceanu have shown that, using global constraints, CHIP can find one solution without search.

A followup [note](http://ianm.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/CSPLib/prob/prob007/puget.pdf) by Puget and Regin shows that all solutions can be found in ILOG's Solver with reasonable efficiency.

Gent, McDonald and Smith have shown, in a paper ([Conditional Symmetry in the All-Interval Series Problem](http://ianm.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/CSPLib/prob/prob007/gmsSymCon03.pdf)) in the proceedings of [SymCon03](https://www.it.uu.se/research/group/astra/SymCon/SymCon03/notes.html), that a reformulation of the problem yields all solutions 50 times faster than previous techniques.
