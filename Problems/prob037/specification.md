Peg Solitaire (also known as Hi-Q) is played on a board with a number of holes. In the English version of the game, the board is in the shape of a cross with 33 holes:

      OOO
      OOO
    OOOOOOO
    OOOOOOO
    OOOOOOO
      OOO
      OOO

Pegs ('X's here) are arranged on the board so that at least one hole remains. A number of different problems arise from Solitaire, e.g. finding a path from the initial to a goal state, or finding the shortest number of moves to a state where no more moves are possible.

Moves are draughts/checkers-like and are horizontal or vertical: 

    XXO -> OOX

The following is the classic 'central' version of the game:

     Start:     Goal:
      XXX        OOO
      XXX        OOO
    XXXXXXX    OOOOOOO
    XXXOXXX -> OOOXOOO
    XXXXXXX    OOOOOOO
      XXX        OOO
      XXX        OOO

The French version of the game has four extra holes: 

      OOO
     OOOOO
    OOOOOOO
    OOOOOOO
    OOOOOOO
     OOOOO
      OOO

Other board types, such as the Solitaire Triangle, also exist.
