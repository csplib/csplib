<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><em>The general definition of the</em> <strong>SensorDisCSP</strong> <em>family is as follows:</em></p>
<p>The target tracking in distributed sensor network problem
(SensorDisCSP) is a real distributed resource allocation problem.
This problem consists of
a set of $n$ <em>stationary</em> sensors,
$\mathcal{S} = \{s_{1}, \ldots, s_{n}\}$,
and a set of $m$ targets, $\mathcal{T} = \{t_{1}, \ldots, t_{m}\}$,
moving through their sensing range.
The objective is to track each target by sensors.
Thus, sensors have to cooperate for tracking all targets.
In order for a target to be tracked accurately, at least
three sensors must concurrently turn on overlapping sectors.
This allows the target&rsquo;s position to be triangulated.
However, each sensor can track at most one target.
Hence, a solution is an assignment of three distinct sensors
to each target.</p>
<p>A solution must satisfy the <strong>visibility</strong>
and the <strong>compatibility</strong> constraints.
The <em>visibility constraint</em> defines the set of sensors to which
a target is visible. This mainly depends on the sensing range
of each sensor and to the presence of obstacles in the sensing range.
The sensing ranges of all sensors form a <em>sensing graph</em>.
The <em>compatibility constraint</em> defines the compatibility among sensors
(sensors within the communication range of each other). There may be
obstacles or noise sources on the communication area leading to breaking
links of communication. The compatibility constraints are represented
through the <em>communication network</em>.</p>
<h3>Grid Model</h3>
<p>The Grid-based SensorDisCSP (or GSensorDisCSP, for short) is a specific
variant of the general SensorDisCSP:
as before, we have multiple sensors $\mathcal{S} = \{s_{1}, \ldots, s_{n}\}$,
multiple objects/tagets $\mathcal{T} = \{t_{1}, \ldots, t_{m}\}$ which are to
be tracked by the sensors subject to visibility and compatibility
constraints, and the goal is to allocate three sensors to track each
object/target, while keeping these triplets of sensors pair-wise disjoint.
However, in GSensorDisCSP the sensors are located on the nodes of a
uniform grid of $n$ nodes, and the target objects are located within
the surface enclosed by the grid (i.e., the grid specifies the
generally trackable region).</p>

<p>Fig.1 shows an example of the target tracking problem in distributed
sensor networks where $s_{i}$ represents the sensor and $t_{j}$
represents the target. In this example sensors are arranged on
the nodes of a uniform grid and it is assumed that only one target
can exist in one area. This instance consists of 2 targets:
$t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ and 6 sensors: $s_{1}$, $\ldots$, and $s_{6}$.
Each target has a set of sensors that can possibly detect it
(the sensors in the nodes of the area where the target is located),
as depicted by the bipartite sensing graph in Fig.1(a).
For example, $t_{1}$ can be tracked by $s_{1}$, $s_{2}$, $s_{4}$, and $s_{5}$.
In addition, it is required that each target be assigned three
sensors that satisfy a compatibility relation with each other;
this compatibility relation is depicted by the communication network
in Fig.1(b). Each sensor can communicate with all sensors that are at
most 1 hop (rectilinear and/or diagonal) from it.
Finally, it is required that each sensor only track at most one target.
A possible solution is depicted in Fig.1(c), where the set of
three sensors assigned to each target is indicated by the green edges.</p>
<h2>Distributed CSP Formulation</h2>
<p>In the following, three Distributed CSP based formalizations for
target tracking in sensor network problem are shown.
These are <strong>TaV</strong>, <strong>STaV</strong> and <strong>SaV</strong>.</p>
<h3>Target as Variable (TaV):</h3>
<p>Target as Variable (TaV) is a model of formalization which defines
an agent for each target (i.e., the set of agent is exactly the
set of targets $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{T}$).
There are three variables per agent, one for each sensor that we need
to allocate to the corresponding target. The domain of each variable
is the set of sensors that can detect the corresponding target
(the visibility constraint defines such sensors).
The inter-agent constraints between the variables of one agent
(target) specify that the three sensors assigned to the target
must be distinct.</p>
<p><center>
<figure>
  <figcaption><strong>Fig.2:</strong> <em>Target as Variable formulation of the problem in Fig.1</em>.</figcaption>
  <img src="assets/TaV.png" alt="Target as Variable formulation" width="600">
</figure>
</center></p>
<p>In Fig. 2, the instance of target tracking in distributed sensor network
shown in Fig. 1 is formalized as a <strong>TaV</strong> problem. Each target is represented
by an agent, i.e., there is two agents $A_{1}$ representing $t_{1}$ and
agent $A_{2}$ representing $t_{2}$. Each agent controls 3 distinct variables
(one for each sensor to track the target).
Agent $A_{1}$ has variables $x_{1}^{1}$, $x_{1}^{2}$, and $x_{1}^{3}$,
while agent $A_{2}$ has variables $x_{2}^{1}$, $x_{2}^{2}$, and $x_{2}^{3}$.
The domain of variables of each agent is the set of sensors that can track
the target represented by the that agent.
Target $t_{1}$ can be tracked by
$s_{1}$, $s_{2}$, $s_{4}$, and $s_{5}$, thus,
$D_{1}^{1}=D_{1}^{2}=D_{1}^{3}=\{1,2,4,5\}$.
For agent/target $A_{2}/t_{2}$, $D_{2}^{1}=D_{2}^{2}=D_{2}^{3}=\{2,3,5,6\}$.
The domains are used to represent the <em>visibility</em> constraint.
There is a $\texttt{clique}$ constraint between variables of each agent:
$\texttt{clique}(3,[x_{1}^{1},x_{1}^{2},x_{1}^{3}])$ (respectively
$\texttt{clique}(3,[x_{2}^{1},x_{2}^{2},x_{2}^{3}])$) specifying that there
is a maximum clique of size 3 in the communication graph between sensors
assigned to target $t_{1}$ (respectively $t_{2}$).
$\texttt{clique}$ constraint is used for representing the
<em>compatibility</em> constraint.
An $\texttt{allDiff}$ constraint on the variables of agents having
a common sensor in there domains is used to specify that each sensor
can track at most one target:
$\texttt{allDiff}(x_{1}^{1},x_{1}^{2},x_{1}^{3},x_{2}^{1},x_{2}^{2},x_{2}^{3})$.</p>
<p>A solution (Fig.1(c)) to that problem is:
$x_{1}^{1}=1,x_{1}^{2}=2,x_{1}^{3}=4,x_{2}^{1}=3,x_{2}^{2}=5,x_{2}^{3}=6$.</p>
<h3>Sensor-Target as Variable (STaV):</h3>
<p>Sensor-Target as Variable (<strong>STaV</strong>) is a model of formalization which
defines a variable for a pair of a sensor and a target. Each sensor
$s_{i}$ is modeled by an agent $A_{i}$. For each agent $A_{i}$ there
is a binary variable $x_{i}^{j}$ (i.e., $D_{i}^{j}=\{0,1\}$)
for each target $t_{j}$ that can be tracked by $s_{i}$.
For each sensor, there is a constraint specifying that it can not track
more than one target: $\forall s_{i}\in\mathcal{S},\sum_{j=1}^{m}{x_{i}^{j}}\leq 1$.
For each target, there is a constraint specifying that it must be tracked
by at least 3 sensors: $\forall t_{j}\in\mathcal{T},\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}^{j}}\geq 3$.</p>
<p><center>
<figure>
  <figcaption><strong>Fig.3:</strong> <em>Sensor-Target as Variable formulation of the problem in Fig.1</em>.</figcaption>
  <img src="assets/STaV.png" alt="Sensor-Target as Variable formulation" width="500">
</figure>
</center></p>
<p>An example of a sensor network shown in Fig. 1 is formalized as a
<strong>STaV</strong> problem shown in Fig. 3.
In Fig. 3, $x_{i}^{j}$ represents a variable of $s_{i}$ for target $t_{j}$.
For each sensor $s_{i}$, variables are defined for targets that can
be observed by $s_{i}$.
In this example, $A_{1}$, $A_{3}$, $A_{4}$, and $A_{6}$ have one
variable each because they represent sensors that can observe
only one target ($t_{1}$ for $s_{1}$ and $s_{4}$ and
$t_{2}$ for $s_{3}$ and $s_{6}$).
$s_{2}$ and $s_{5}$ have two variables because they can observe
two targets (i.e., $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$).
A value of $x_{i}^{j}$ represents which sensors are allocated to $t_{j}$.
We have 4 constraints in that problem where constraints
$c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ specifying that a sensor can track at most one target
and constraints $c_{3}$ and $c_{4}$ specifying that a target must be tracked
by at least 3 sensors.</p>
<ul>
<li>$c_{1}: x_{2}^{1}+x_{2}^{2}\leq 1$</li>
<li>$c_{2}: x_{5}^{1}+x_{5}^{2}\leq 1$</li>
<li>$c_{3}: x_{1}^{1}+x_{2}^{1}+x_{4}^{1}+x_{5}^{1}\geq 3$</li>
<li>$c_{4}: x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+x_{5}^{2}+x_{6}^{2}\geq 3$</li>
</ul>
<p>A solution (Fig.1(c)) to that problem is:
$x_{1}^{1}=1,x_{2}^{1}=1,x_{2}^{2}=0,x_{3}^{2}=1,x_{4}^{1}=1,x_{5}^{1}=0,x_{5}^{2}=1,x_{6}^{2}=1$.</p>
<h3>Sensors as Variable (SaV):</h3>
<p>Sensor as Variable (<strong>SaV</strong>) is a model of formalization which
defines an agent $A_{i}$ for each sensor $s_{i}$.
For each agent/sensor $A_{i}$ there is one single variable $x_{i}$.
The domain of a variable $x_{i}$ is defined by the set of targets that
sensor $s_{i}$ can track. There is an $\texttt{atleast}$ constraint
on the variables $[x_{i},&hellip;,x_{k}]$ that can track each target,
i.e., $\forall t_{j}\in\mathcal{T},\texttt{atleast}(3,[x_{i},\ldots,x_{k}],j)$
such that $\forall x_{l}\in [x_{i},\ldots,x_{k}]$, $j\in D_{l}$.</p>
<p><center>
<figure>
  <figcaption><strong>Fig.4:</strong> <em>Sensor as Variable formulation of the problem in Fig.1</em>.</figcaption>
  <img src="assets/SaV.png" alt="Sensor as Variable formulation" width="500">
</figure>
</center></p>
<p>An example of a sensor network shown in Fig. 1 is formalized as a
<strong>SaV</strong> problem shown in Fig. 4.
In Fig. 4, each sensor $s_{i}$ is represented by a variable $x_{i}$
controlled by agent $A_{i}$. Thus, there is 6 variales/agents
(i.e., $x_{1},\ldots,x_{6}$). The domain of each variable $x_{i}$
is the set of targets that $s_{i}$ can track. Thus,
$D_{1}=D_{4}=\{1\}$,
$D_{3}=D_{6}=\{2\}$ and
$D_{2}=D_{5}=\{1,2\}$.
There is 2 $\texttt{atleast}$ constraints (one for each target):
$\texttt{atleast}(3,[x_{1},x_{2},x_{4},x_{5}],1)$
and $\texttt{atleast}(3,[x_{2},x_{3},x_{5},x_{6}],2)$ specifying
that at least 3 sensors among $\{s_{1},s_{2},s_{4},s_{5}\}$
must track target $t_{1}$ and at least 3 sensors among
$\{s_{2},s_{3},s_{5},s_{6}\}$ must track target $t_{2}$.</p>
<p>A solution (Fig.1(c)) to that problem is:
$x_{1}=1,x_{2}=1,x_{3}=2,x_{4}=1,x_{5}=2,x_{6}=2$.</p>
